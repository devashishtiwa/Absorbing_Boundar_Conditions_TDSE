# Absorbing_Boundar_Conditions_TDSE

In this Project work, we are using absorbing boundary conditions, with the Crank-Nicolson scheme
Ref. [3] to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation numerically with Python, for a Gaussian
wave packet using three different methods, namely, Linear Approximation Method Ref. [1],
Rational function Approximation Ref. [2], New Absorbing Boundary Conditions Ref. [3].
Then there results, were plotted, and accuracy was determined. We also simulated the Scattering for
single and double potential barriers with and without Absorbing boundary conditions.
