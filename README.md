# Absorbing_Boundar_Conditions_TDSE

In this Project work, we are using absorbing boundary conditions, with the Crank-Nicolson scheme
Ref. To solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation numerically with Python, for a Gaussian
wave packet using three different methods, namely, Linear Approximation Method Ref,
Rational function Approximation,  New Absorbing Boundary Conditions Ref.
Then there results, were plotted, and accuracy was determined. We also simulated the Scattering for
single and double potential barriers with and without Absorbing boundary conditions. We independently generalized the
Crank Nikolson method for Linear and Rational function approximation and have verified that numerically.
